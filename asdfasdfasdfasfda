Stress Tests: 99.11% and 99.76%—both solid, with the second edging out. The API can take a hit and stay up.
Normal Days: 98.19% (weak), 99.76%, 99.83% (stellar). Two out of three are near-perfect, even at 1M+ requests.

First Stress Test Day: 1,320,709 - 11,788 = 1,308,921
Second Stress Test Day: 761,663 - 1,848 = 759,815
First Normal Day: 156,441 - 2,824 = 153,617
Second Normal Day: 1,488,396 - 2,477 = 1,485,919
Third Normal Day: 1,188,154 - 2,870 = 1,185,284

First Stress Test: 1,308,921 ÷ 86,400 = 15.15 RPS
Second Stress Test: 759,815 ÷ 86,400 = 8.79 RPS
First Normal Day: 153,617 ÷ 86,400 = 1.78 RPS
Second Normal Day: 1,485,919 ÷ 86,400 = 17.20 RPS
Third Normal Day: 1,185,284 ÷ 86,400 = 13.72 RPS

Step 3: Updated Summary Based on Availability
Overall Stats
Total Successful Requests: 1,308,921 + 153,617 + 1,485,919 + 1,185,284 + 759,815 = 4,893,556
Total Requests: 1,320,709 + 156,441 + 1,488,396 + 1,188,154 + 761,663 = 4,915,363
Overall Availability: (4,893,556 ÷ 4,915,363) × 100 = 99.56%

By Day
Second Normal Day (99.83%):
Volume: 1,488,396 (highest)
Takeaway: Still the champ—near-perfect at max volume.
Second Stress Test Day (99.76%):
Volume: 761,663 (lowest of the high-volume days)
Takeaway: Excellent under stress—matches the third normal day and beats the first stress test.
Third Normal Day (99.76%):
Volume: 1,188,154
Takeaway: Tied with the new stress test—super reliable at high volume.
First Stress Test Day (99.11%):
Volume: 1,320,709
Takeaway: Good, but the weakest of the high-volume days. Still above 99%.
First Normal Day (98.19%):
Volume: 156,441 (lowest)
Takeaway: Remains the outlier—below 99% with light traffic.
