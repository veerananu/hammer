what changes you made

Here’s exactly what differs in that minimal snippet from your earlier attempts:

Aliased the AWS SDK’s config import so it can’t be confused with your configclient package:

go
Copy
Edit
import sdkconfig "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
Dropped any use of a non-existent WithTransportOptions. Instead we use the real, supported option:

go
Copy
Edit
sdkconfig.WithHTTPClient(httpClient)
Read your CA bundle from AWS_CA_BUNDLE into a *x509.CertPool, then built an http.Client whose transport uses that pool:

go
Copy
Edit
pem, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(caPath)
pool := x509.NewCertPool()
pool.AppendCertsFromPEM(pem)

httpClient := &http.Client{
  Transport: &http.Transport{
    TLSClientConfig: &tls.Config{RootCAs: pool},
  },
}
Loaded the SDK config with that HTTP client so all AWS calls use your corporate roots:

go
Copy
Edit
awsCfg, err := sdkconfig.LoadDefaultConfig(
  context.Background(),
  sdkconfig.WithHTTPClient(httpClient),
)
Injected that awsCfg into your shared configclient:

go
Copy
Edit
configclient.SetCustomConfig(&awsCfg)
By making those five changes—and especially by using only WithHTTPClient—you eliminate the “no WithTransportOptions” compile error and ensure the SDK actually trusts your custom CA bundle.
