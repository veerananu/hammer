The OpenShift has a scraping limit for each deployment was set at 5k metrics. Our project desktop log forwarder generates 80k metrics per scrape, but OpenShift has a scraping limit for each deployment is 80k metrics. Our goal was to find a solution that would allow us to handle the full metric load without disrupting the application or requiring changes to the code. The addition of vmagent sidecar technology to the desktop log forwarder allowed us to redirect the full 80k metrics into our contact center's VictoriaMetrics system without modifying the existing system. By implementing this solution, we were able to capture complete metrics, improving operational visibility without increasing the complexity of our applications.

With the help of the vmagent sidecar solution, I demonstrated the concept of 'Invent and Simplify' by handling the large volume of metrics without needing to change the code. The approach aligned with USAA's philosophy of 'Deliver Results,' as it provided a quick, effective solution that maintained the integrity of the application while improving metric storage. Moreover, I demonstrated 'Bias for Action' by identifying and implementing this solution proactively, preventing any potential disruptions in our metrics collection process.


I was tasked with creating a backup and restore solution for the Grafana database from the active instance to a passive instance without stopping the Grafana service. The expected outcome was to ensure continuous availability while managing database backups. I successfully developed scripts that facilitated this process, allowing for seamless backups and restores. Additionally, instead of manually moving dashboards and folders from OpenShift to the on-prem Grafana instance, I created automation scripts that reduced the time required for this task from 1-2 days to just 15-20 minutes. This improvement significantly enhanced operational efficiency and minimized downtime.


To achieve these goals, I demonstrated ‘Invent and Simplify’ by automating the backup and dashboard migration processes, which eliminated manual intervention and streamlined operations. This aligns with the principle of ‘Deliver Results,’ as I was able to provide effective solutions that greatly reduced the time and effort required for these tasks. By taking ownership of these projects, I ensured that the Grafana instances remained available and operational, ultimately enhancing the reliability and performance of our monitoring solutions.


I was tasked with setting up a phone forensic service to monitor digital voice service level objectives (SLOs). The expected outcome was to create a robust monitoring system that captures payloads from Nuance, posts them to Kafka for event processing, and visualizes the data through dashboards for all digital APIs. I successfully implemented this service, enhancing our ability to track and manage digital voice performance effectively. This monitoring solution was crucial for improving operational insights and ensuring high-quality service delivery.


In accomplishing this task, I demonstrated ‘Customer Obsession’ by focusing on the quality of the digital voice services we provided. By setting up a comprehensive monitoring system, I ensured that we could quickly identify and address any issues impacting performance. Additionally, I exhibited ‘Bias for Action’ by efficiently developing and implementing the service, which contributed to better operational outcomes. Furthermore, I participated in a Spark competition, where my team achieved 4th place, showcasing my commitment to continuous learning and collaboration in data processing technologies.
