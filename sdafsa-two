Cost Analysis for Architectures

Assumptions:

Metrics: 500 metrics filtered every minute.

Data Size: Each metric event = 1 KB.

Monthly Duration: 43,200 minutes (30 days × 24 hours × 60 minutes).

Total Data: .

First Architecture:

CloudWatch Metric Streams:

Total updates:  updates.

Cost: .

Kinesis Firehose (HTTP Delivery):

Data ingestion: .

Cost: .

S3 Storage (for 2 days retention):

Cost: .

Kinesis Firehose (S3 Delivery):

Data ingestion: .

Cost: .

S3 Storage (for 7 days retention):

Stored data: .

Cost for 7 days: .

Lambda Execution:

Total invocations: .

Execution time: 5 seconds/event.

Memory: 128 MB.

Compute cost:

Invocation cost:

Total Monthly Cost (Second Architecture):

Cost Comparison:

First Architecture: 65.5 USD/month.

Second Architecture: 88.34 USD/month (with 5s/event Lambda execution).

Key Notes:

The first architecture is more cost-effective, but the second architecture provides longer storage retention and additional processing flexibility.
