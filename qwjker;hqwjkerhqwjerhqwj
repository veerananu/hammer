Latency Takeaways
Normal Days: 99.96% of requests are <5s—only 0.04% (1 in 2,500) take longer. Latency is near-perfect.
Stress Tests: 99.50% (Day 1) to 99.81% (Day 2) are <5s—0.19% to 0.50% exceed 5s. Day 1 lags more (1 in 200 slow) than Day 2 (1 in 500).
Worst Case: Stress Test Day 1—0.50% slow (6,467 requests). Highest latency issues under load.
Best Case: Normal Days—0.04% slow (480-556 requests). Barely any latency problems.
