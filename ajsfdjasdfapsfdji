Error rates - HTTP 4xx/5xx errors, application exceptions
Transaction success rates - Critical business process completion rates
Load balancer health - Target health, connection counts, latency
Infrastructure Health
Database performance - Query response times, connection pool utilization, deadlocks
Server resource utilization - CPU, memory, disk usage across all tiers
Network performance - Inter-VPC communication latency, packet loss
Auto-scaling events - Instance launches/terminations, scaling triggers
Security Monitoring
WAF metrics - Blocked requests, attack patterns, rule violations

1. Security VPC (VPC-1) Monitoring
A. Web Application Firewall (WAF) & Firewall
Blocked/Allowed Requests:
Shows if attacks (like SQL injection, XSS) are being stopped or if legitimate users are being blocked by mistake.
Top Offending IPs:
Helps identify sources of repeated attacks or abuse.
Rule Triggers:
Which WAF/firewall rules are being triggered most often? This can show new attack patterns or misconfigurations.
B. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Request Count:
How many requests are coming in? Sudden spikes can mean attacks or increased usage.
HTTP Error Rates (4xx, 5xx):
High error rates can mean app bugs, misconfigurations, or attacks.
Target Health:
Are your backend servers healthy and able to serve traffic?
Latency:
How long does it take to respond to requests? High latency means slow user experience.
C. Internet Gateway
Traffic Volume:
Monitor for unusual spikes in inbound/outbound traffic, which could indicate data exfiltration or DDoS attacks.
2. Application VPC (VPC-2) Monitoring
A. Presentation Tier (Subnet-1)
Server Health (WFM, Data Explorer, ASC Web):
CPU, Memory, Disk Usage: High usage can cause slowness or crashes.
Network In/Out: Unusual spikes can mean attacks or data leaks.
Application Logs: Track errors, warnings, and user activity.
Application Load Balancer (if present):
Same metrics as above: request count, error rates, latency, target health.
B. Application Tier (Subnet-2)
App Server Health (WFM App, ASC):
CPU, Memory, Disk: Watch for resource exhaustion.
Application Logs: Look for failed transactions, slow queries, or exceptions.
API Metrics: Number of API calls, error rates, response times.
C. Data Tier (Subnet-3)
Database (RDS):
CPU, Memory, Storage: High usage can slow down or crash the database.
Read/Write Latency: Slow reads/writes mean slow apps.
Connection Count: Too many connections can exhaust resources.
Replication Lag: If using replicas, lag can cause stale data.
Backup Status: Ensure backups are happening and are successful.
Disk IOPS: High IOPS can indicate heavy usage or inefficient queries.
3. General SaaS Metrics
Per-Tenant Usage:
Active Users: How many users are using the system?
API Calls: How much is each tenant using the system?
Storage Used: How much data is each tenant storing?
Cost/Billing: How much is each tenant costing you (for chargeback or showback)?
Availability/Uptime:
Service Uptime: Are your services available as promised?
Downtime/Incidents: Track outages and their causes.
Security Events:
Failed Logins: Could indicate brute-force attacks.
Unusual Access Patterns: Logins from new locations, times, or devices.
4. Why Monitor These Metrics?
Proactive Problem Detection:
Find and fix issues before users notice.
Security:
Detect and respond to attacks or breaches.
Performance:
Ensure users have a fast, reliable experience.
Cost Control:
Avoid surprise bills and optimize resource usage.
Compliance:
Meet regulatory requirements for logging and monitoring.
Capacity Planning:
Know when to scale up or down.
5. How to Monitor
AWS CloudWatch:
Native AWS service for collecting and visualizing metrics, logs, and alarms.
AWS CloudTrail:
For auditing API calls and user actions.
Third-Party Tools:
Datadog, New Relic, Splunk, etc., for advanced dashboards and alerting.
Custom Dashboards:
For per-tenant visibility and reporting.
Summary Table
Component	Metric	Why Monitor?
WAF/Firewall	Blocked requests, top IPs	Detect attacks, tune rules
Load Balancer	Requests, errors, latency	User experience, detect failures
Servers (all tiers)	CPU, memory, disk, network	Prevent crashes, plan scaling
Application Logs	Errors, warnings, user actions	Debugging, security, compliance
Database (RDS)	CPU, storage, latency, backups	Data integrity, performance, recovery
Per-tenant Usage	API calls, storage, cost	Billing, cost control, capacity
Security Events	Failed logins, access patterns	Detect breaches, compliance
Uptime/Availability	Service health, downtime	SLA compliance, reliability
If you want, I can show you how to set up CloudWatch alarms for any of these, or give you a sample dashboard layout! Just let me know what helps you most.
