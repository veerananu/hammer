Problem Statement:
New and existing members often require readily accessible information about CMK Company's services. Currently, obtaining this information may involve navigating away from their preferred social media platforms, leading to potential friction and missed opportunities for engagement and service adoption. This can result in a suboptimal member experience and potentially hinder CMK's ability to effectively communicate its value proposition and guide interested individuals to its platform.

Solution Description:
To enhance member engagement and streamline access to information, CMK Company will deploy an AI-powered chat agent integrated within popular social media platforms. This intelligent agent will have access to publicly available information regarding CMK's services, enabling it to instantly address inquiries from both new and existing members directly within their familiar social media environment. For members expressing deeper interest or requiring services, the chat agent will seamlessly route them to the appropriate CMK platform, ensuring a smooth transition and improved lead generation.
