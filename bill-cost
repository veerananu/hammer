Here’s a quote focused solely on CloudWatch Metric Streams and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose for delivery to an HTTP endpoint. The costs are based on AWS pricing.

1. CloudWatch Metric Streams
Cost: $0.03 per 1,000 metric updates.
Example:
If you send 10 million metric updates per month:

2. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
Cost Components:
Data Ingestion: $0.029 per GB.

Example:
If 1 TB (1,024 GB) of data is ingested:

1,024×0.029=$29.70
Delivery to HTTP Endpoint:

Delivery costs are included in ingestion costs.
Data Transformation (optional):

$0.01 per GB.
Example:
If 50% of the data (512 GB) is transformed:

5.12
512×0.01=$5.12
Total Monthly Cost Estimate
For 10 million metric updates and 1 TB (1,024 GB) of data delivered:

CloudWatch Metric Streams: $300
Kinesis Data Firehose:
Data Ingestion: $29.70
Optional Transformation: $5.12 (if enabled)
Total Without Transformation: $329.70/month
Total With Transformation: $334.82/month

Notes:
This estimate excludes data transfer out costs because you specified HTTP endpoint delivery via Firehose (no additional charges for endpoint delivery within Firehose).
If you have exact data volumes or different configurations, the numbers can be adjusted.
