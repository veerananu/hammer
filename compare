After evaluating the options, Option A (JSON -> Lambda -> OTLP JSON via HTTP) emerges as the best choice for most scenarios. Here’s why:

Simplicity: Transforming JSON to JSON is straightforward, leveraging Lambda’s built-in tools without requiring Protobuf libraries or .proto files.
Ease of Maintenance and Debugging: JSON’s readability simplifies development, updates, and troubleshooting, reducing long-term effort.
Practicality: While Option B offers performance benefits (smaller payloads, potentially faster parsing), these advantages are marginal unless handling massive metric volumes, which isn’t specified here.
Flexibility: Both options are compatible with the OTel receiver, but Option A avoids the complexity of Protobuf or gRPC setup in Lambda.
Option B could be preferable if specific constraints demand maximum efficiency (e.g., very high metric volumes or a receiver optimized for Protobuf), but without such requirements, Option A’s simplicity and efficiency in development make it the superior choice.

Thus, Option A is the best option because it provides a simpler, more maintainable, and practical solution for transforming CloudWatch Metric Stream JSON into OTLP format and sending it to an OTel receiver via HTTP.
