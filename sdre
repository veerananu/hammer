2. Design Review
This is about checking how your IVR is built, ensuring it's scalable, secure, and handles failures properly.

a. Architecture Review
What it means: Looking at how the system is designed and making sure it’s built for scale and flexibility.
What to do:
Break your system into smaller services (like one for handling calls, and another for playing messages).
Make sure these services can scale independently as needed.
b. Database and Storage
What it means: Ensuring your database can handle the data your IVR uses (like call logs or voice files).
What to do:
Optimize your database so it handles the information efficiently.
Use backup and replication to ensure no data is lost if a server fails.
c. Fault Tolerance
What it means: Ensuring the system keeps working even when parts of it fail.
What to do:
Monitor your services so if one fails, another can take over automatically.
Design services so they don’t rely on a single point of failure (i.e., if one part fails, the whole system doesn’t crash).
d. Security and Compliance
What it means: Making sure your system is secure and follows legal regulations (like data privacy).
What to do:
Encrypt sensitive data (like call recordings).
Use proper authentication to ensure only authorized people can access the system.
e. Monitoring and Observability
What it means: Setting up tools to monitor how the system is running and track down issues when they happen.
What to do:
Create dashboards and alerts for key metrics (like call volume, error rates).
Use logging tools to keep track of what’s happening in the system at all times.

 Welcome Message and Initial Routing
Bad Example: "Thank you for calling our customer support line. Please state your inquiry." (Too generic and doesn't provide clear guidance)
Good Example: "Welcome to [Company Name]. To speak to a customer service representative, press 1. For technical support, press 2." (Clear and concise, with specific options)
2. Voice Recognition and Natural Language Processing
Bad Example: The system fails to understand a caller saying "I can't log in to my account."
Good Example: The system accurately recognizes the query and routes the caller to the appropriate department.
3. Interactive Prompts and Menu Options
Bad Example: A menu with 10+ options that are difficult to remember.
Good Example: A menu with a maximum of 5 options, clearly labeled and easy to understand.
4. Integration with Other Systems
Bad Example: The IVR system cannot access the caller's account information from the CRM system.
Good Example: The IVR system automatically retrieves the caller's account details and provides personalized service.
5. Scalability and Performance
Bad Example: The system crashes during peak call volumes, leading to customer dissatisfaction.
Good Example: The system can handle a significant increase in call volume without experiencing performance issues.
6. Security and Compliance
Bad Example: The system stores caller data in an unsecured database, making it vulnerable to breaches.
Good Example: The system uses encryption and strong security measures to protect sensitive data.
7. Accessibility and Inclusivity
Bad Example: The system does not provide options for callers with hearing impairments.
Good Example: The system offers text-to-speech and speech-to-text options for accessibility.
8. Monitoring and Analytics
Bad Example: The company does not track key performance indicators, making it difficult to identify areas for improvement.
Good Example: The company regularly analyzes call data to identify trends, bottlenecks, and opportunities for optimization.
By avoiding the bad examples and implementing the good ones, you can create an IVR system that is effective, user-friendly, and meets the needs of your customers.
