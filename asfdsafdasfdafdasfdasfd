The vmagent sidecar handles 80k metrics per scrape from our desktop log forwarder, effectively bypassing OpenShift's 5k limit without any code changes. We were able to route metrics directly to VictoriaMetrics using this solution, improving operational visibility and performance. I also developed an automated dashboard migration process for Grafana resulting in a reduction of time from 1-2 days to 15-20 minutes, and enabled database transfers from active to passive instances without downtime. SLOs for the Phone forensic service were created to capture payloads from Nuance and to post them to Kafka for processing. As well as visualizing data across digital APIs via Grafana dashboards.
