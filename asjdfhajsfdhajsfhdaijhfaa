Monitoring SaaS Applications Hosted on AWS: What to Ask and Expect
1. What You Need to Monitor (as a SaaS Consumer)
As a SaaS customer, your focus is on the service level and application performance—not the underlying AWS infrastructure. Key areas to monitor or request visibility into:

Availability/Uptime: Is the application accessible and responsive?
Performance: Are response times within acceptable limits? Any slowdowns?
Error Rates: Are there failed requests, errors, or outages?
Security Events: Any unauthorized access attempts, data breaches, or vulnerabilities?
Usage Metrics: How much of your quota or subscription are you using (API calls, storage, user seats)?
Compliance: Are they meeting compliance requirements (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)?
Incident Reporting: How and when will you be notified of incidents or outages?
2. What Metrics Should the SaaS Provider Share?
Request a Service Level Agreement (SLA) and regular reporting on:

Uptime/Availability: Monthly uptime percentage, downtime incidents, and root cause analysis.
Latency/Performance: Average and percentile response times for key operations.
Error Rates: Number and types of errors (e.g., 4xx, 5xx HTTP errors).
Security Metrics: Summary of security incidents, patching status, and audit logs (if applicable).
Capacity/Usage: Your usage stats (API calls, storage, user activity).
Maintenance Windows: Advance notice of planned maintenance and expected impact.
Compliance Reports: Copies of compliance certifications or audit summaries.
3. How Will They Share These Metrics?
Customer Portal/Dashboard: Real-time and historical metrics.
API Access: For integration with your own monitoring tools.
Email/Reports: Regular (weekly/monthly) email reports or downloadable PDFs.
Incident Notifications: Email, SMS, or webhook notifications for outages or incidents.
Support Channels: For ad-hoc queries or incident follow-up.
4. Questions to Ask Your SaaS Provider
What is your SLA for uptime and response time?
How do you monitor your own infrastructure and application health?
What metrics and logs can you share with us, and how often?
How will you notify us of incidents, outages, or security events?
Can we access a real-time dashboard or API for monitoring?
What compliance certifications do you maintain, and can you share audit reports?
How do you handle data backups and disaster recovery?
What is your process for planned maintenance and customer notification?
5. What You Don’t Need to Monitor
You do not need to monitor:

VPC, subnets, firewalls, or load balancers directly (that’s the provider’s job)
Underlying AWS resource health (EC2, RDS, etc.)
Internal network traffic or security group rules
