2.0 Pro Experimental. Lacks access to real-time info and some Gemini features.
You've got a great question! Sharing Amazon CloudWatch metrics across AWS accounts is a common need for centralized monitoring, security auditing, and cost management. Here's a breakdown of the best ways to achieve this, along with their pros, cons, and considerations:

1. CloudWatch Metric Streams (Recommended for Most Cases)

How it Works:  CloudWatch Metric Streams allow you to continuously stream metrics to a destination of your choice, including destinations in other AWS accounts. The most common and recommended destination is a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, which can then deliver the metrics to S3, Redshift, OpenSearch Service, or a third-party provider (like Datadog, Splunk, etc.) even if that destination is in another AWS account.  You can also send directly to an S3 bucket in another account, but Firehose provides more flexibility and features.

Key Steps (Cross-Account with Firehose):

Source Account (Where Metrics Originate):

Create a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. Important: For cross-account delivery, you'll need to specify a destination that is in the target account (e.g., an S3 bucket, an OpenSearch cluster). You'll do this using the destination's ARN.
Create a CloudWatch Metric Stream, selecting the metrics (namespaces, dimensions, etc.) you want to stream. Choose your Firehose delivery stream as the destination.
Grant necessary permissions. Firehose needs permission to write to the destination in the target account. This is typically done using an IAM role that Firehose assumes. The target account needs to trust this role.
Target Account (Where Metrics are Sent):

Create the destination resource (e.g., S3 bucket, OpenSearch Service domain).
Configure the destination resource's access policy (e.g., S3 bucket policy, OpenSearch domain access policy) to allow the Firehose role from the source account to write data. This is crucial for cross-account access. This policy should include the sts:AssumeRole action. A typical policy snippet on the target account's S3 bucket would look like this:
JSON

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<Source Account ID>:role/<Firehose Role Name>"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<Target Bucket Name>",
        "arn:aws:s3:::<Target Bucket Name>/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
(If using OpenSearch Service) Configure an access policy on your OpenSearch domain that allows the Firehose role to write to it.
IAM Role Configuration (Critical for Cross-Account):

The IAM role you create for Firehose in the source account should have:
Permissions to read from CloudWatch (cloudwatch:GetMetricData, cloudwatch:ListMetrics, etc. are usually NOT needed, as the metric stream handles this).
Permissions to write to Kinesis Data Firehose (firehose:PutRecord, firehose:PutRecordBatch).
The sts:AssumeRole permission to assume a role in the target account. The Resource in this permission should be the ARN of a role in the target account that has permissions to write to the final destination (S3, OpenSearch, etc.).
Example trust policy on the Firehose Role in the source account:
JSON

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "firehose.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
The IAM role you create in the target account (which the Firehose role will assume) should have:
The necessary permissions to write to the final destination (S3, OpenSearch Service, etc.). For example, if the destination is S3, grant s3:PutObject and other relevant permissions.
A trust policy that allows the Firehose role in the source account to assume it. Example:
JSON

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<Source Account ID>:role/<Firehose Role Name>"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

Pros:

Near Real-Time: Metrics are streamed continuously, providing very low latency.
Scalable: Kinesis Data Firehose automatically scales to handle high throughput.
Flexible: Supports various destinations and transformations (via Firehose).
Cost-Effective: Generally the most cost-effective option for continuous, high-volume metric data.
Least Privilege: Uses IAM roles for fine-grained access control.
Cons:

Requires setting up Kinesis Data Firehose and understanding its configuration. While not overly complex, it's more involved than a simple API call.
You need to manage the destination resource (e.g., S3 bucket, OpenSearch domain) in the target account.
2. CloudWatch Logs Subscription Filters (Cross-Account)

How it Works: If your metrics are already being written to CloudWatch Logs (e.g., from Lambda functions, EC2 instances with the CloudWatch Agent), you can create cross-account subscription filters. These filters send log events (which can contain your metric data) to a destination in another account, such as a Kinesis Data Stream, a Kinesis Data Firehose stream, or a Lambda function.

Key Steps (Cross-Account):

Source Account (Where Logs are):
Create the Cloudwatch Logs Log Group if it doesn't exist.
Create a subscription filter on your CloudWatch Logs log group.
Set the destination to a Kinesis Data Stream, Firehose stream, or Lambda function in the target account (using the destination's ARN).
Grant necessary permissions to CloudWatch Logs to write to the destination in the target account. Similar to Metric Streams, this involves creating IAM roles with appropriate trust relationships and permissions.
Target Account (Where Logs are Sent):

Create the destination resource (Kinesis stream, Firehose stream, or Lambda function).
Configure the destination resource's access policy to allow CloudWatch Logs from the source account to write to it (again, using sts:AssumeRole). The setup is very similar to the Metric Streams/Firehose example above.
IAM Role Configuration

Similar principle to Metric Streams, with Cloudwatch Logs Service Principal needing to be able to assume a role in the target account, and that target role having permissions to write to the final destination.
Pros:

Good for scenarios where your metrics are already in CloudWatch Logs.
Can use Lambda functions as destinations for custom processing.
Cons:

Only works with metrics that are logged to CloudWatch Logs.
Potentially higher latency compared to Metric Streams, as it's based on log processing.
Can become complex if you need to extract metrics from unstructured log data. Metric filter patterns can extract data from logs, but for complex cases, this might be better handled in a Lambda function in the target account.
3. CloudWatch Cross-Account Observability (Limited Sharing)

* **How It Works:**  This feature in CloudWatch allows you to create "monitoring accounts" that can view data from "source accounts." This is designed for *read-only* access to dashboards, metrics, logs, and traces in a central location. It's not a full data *transfer* mechanism.

* **Key Steps:**
  1. **Source Accounts:** Configure each source account to share data with the monitoring account.
  2. **Monitoring Account:** Set up the monitoring account to link to the source accounts.

* **Pros:**
   * **Centralized View:** Provides a single pane of glass for monitoring multiple accounts.
   * **Easy Setup:**  Relatively easy to configure compared to setting up data streaming.
   * **Good for Dashboards:** Ideal for creating consolidated dashboards.

* **Cons:**
    * **Read-Only:** You can't modify data or create alarms in the source accounts from the monitoring account.
    * **Limited Data Transfer:** This isn't designed for sending large volumes of raw metric data to another account for processing or storage.  It's primarily for viewing data within the CloudWatch console.
    *  Doesn't allow you to use the data with other AWS services in the monitoring account (e.g., you can't easily analyze the data in Athena or build custom applications on it).
4. Pull-Based Approach (Using GetMetricData or GetMetricStatistics API)

How it Works: You could have a process (e.g., a Lambda function, an EC2 instance) in the target account that periodically calls the CloudWatch GetMetricData or GetMetricStatistics API in the source account to retrieve metrics.

Key Steps:

Source Account: No special setup is needed on the source account other than ensuring that metrics are being published to CloudWatch.
Target Account:
Create an IAM role with permission to call cloudwatch:GetMetricData (or GetMetricStatistics) in the source account. This requires a cross-account IAM role setup.
Create a Lambda function (or other process) that uses the AWS SDK to call the CloudWatch API, authenticating with the cross-account IAM role.
The Lambda function would then store or process the retrieved metrics.
IAM Role Configuration (Source Account):
Create a role with permission to access Cloudwatch metrics (cloudwatch:GetMetricData).
Create a trust policy on this role that allows the target account's lambda (or other principal) to assume it:
JSON

   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<Target Account ID>:role/<Lambda Role Name>"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
       }
     ]
   }
IAM Role Configuration (Target Account):
Create a role with permission to invoke Lambda, and also to assume the role in the source account.
The trust policy should allow the Lambda service to assume this role:
JSON

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
           "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
         },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }]
}
Pros:

Simple to implement for small-scale, infrequent metric retrieval.
Full control over the retrieval process.
Cons:

Not Real-Time: Introduces latency due to the polling nature.
Scalability Issues: Can hit API rate limits if you're retrieving a large number of metrics frequently. GetMetricData has higher limits than GetMetricStatistics.
Cost: API calls are billed, and frequent polling can increase costs.
Complexity: Requires managing the polling logic and error handling.
Choosing the Right Method

CloudWatch Metric Streams + Kinesis Data Firehose: Best for most scenarios needing continuous, near real-time, and scalable metric sharing.
CloudWatch Logs Subscription Filters: Good if your metrics are already in CloudWatch Logs.
CloudWatch Cross-Account Observability: Excellent for centralized viewing of metrics across accounts, but not for data transfer or processing.
Pull-Based Approach (API): Suitable for infrequent, small-scale retrieval, but not recommended for production workloads with high volume or low latency requirements.
Remember to always follow the principle of least privilege when configuring IAM roles and policies. Carefully consider your latency, scalability, and cost requirements when selecting a method. I strongly recommend starting with CloudWatch Metric Streams and Kinesis Data Firehose unless you have a specific reason to choose another approach.
