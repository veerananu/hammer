Mapping Performance Metrics to Your Architecture
1. Response Time (Latency)
Relevant Services:
Application Load Balancer (ALB) in VPC-2
Presentation Tier (WFM server, Nice Data Explorer, ASC web server)
Application Tier (WFM app server, ASC)
API endpoints exposed by the SaaS app
What to Ask:
Average and percentile response times for user logins, dashboard loads, report generation, and API calls.
2. Throughput
Relevant Services:
Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Presentation and Application Tiers (all app servers)
What to Ask:
Maximum and average requests per second/minute/hour handled by the ALB and app servers.
3. Error Rate
Relevant Services:
Application Load Balancer (ALB)
All app servers (WFM, ASC, Nice Data Explorer)
What to Ask:
Error rates for user/API requests, broken down by type (4xx, 5xx, timeouts, authentication errors).
4. Application Availability
Relevant Services:
Entire SaaS application (end-to-end, including ALB, app servers, and database)
What to Ask:
Uptime percentage for the whole service, and for critical endpoints (login, data access, reporting).
Outage history and root cause analysis.
5. Resource Utilization
Relevant Services:
API endpoints (rate limits)
Storage (database usage, file storage if applicable)
User sessions (concurrent users)
What to Ask:
Your current usage vs. quota for API calls, storage, and user seats.
6. User Experience Metrics
Relevant Services:
Web front-end (Presentation Tier: WFM server, Nice Data Explorer, ASC web server)
What to Ask:
Page load times, TTFB, and transaction completion times for key workflows.
7. Scalability
Relevant Services:
Application Load Balancer and all app servers
What to Ask:
Results of load testing, and whether performance degrades under high load.
How the system scales during peak usage.
