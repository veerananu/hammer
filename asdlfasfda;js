Metric Stream (Account A):

CloudWatch in Account A streams metrics via Kinesis Firehose.

The stream is configured to deliver to an S3 bucket in Account B.

Firehose (Account A):

Firehose writes metrics to an S3 bucket in Account B, which is KMS encrypted.

Firehose must have IAM permissions (in Account A) and the KMS key in Account B must allow access.

S3 Trigger (Account B):

When a new object lands in the S3 bucket, it triggers a Lambda function.

Lambda Function (Account B):

Lambda retrieves the object (needs S3 read and KMS decrypt permissions).

It parses the metrics and sends them to an OpenTelemetry collector endpoint
