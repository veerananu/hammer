Cost Analysis for Architectures
 Assumptions:- Metrics: 500 metrics filtered every minute.- Data Size: Each metric event = 1 KB.- Monthly Duration: 43,200 minutes (30 days × 24 hours × 60 minutes).- Total Data: 0.5 MB/min × 43,200 = 21.6 GB/month.--
First Architecture:
 1. CloudWatch Metric Streams:
   - Total updates: 500 × 43,200 = 21,600,000 updates.
   - Cost: 21,600,000 / 1,000 × 0.003 = 64.8 USD/month.
 2. Kinesis Firehose (HTTP Delivery):
   - Data ingestion: 21.6 GB.
   - Cost: 21.6 × 0.029 = 0.63 USD/month.
 3. S3 Storage (for 2 days retention):
   - Stored data: 21.6 GB/month ÷ 15 = 1.44 GB/day.
   - Cost for 2 days: 1.44 × 2 × 0.023 = 0.066 USD/month.
 Total Monthly Cost (First Architecture):
 65.5 USD/month

Second Architecture:
 1. CloudWatch Metric Streams:
   - Total updates: 21,600,000.
   - Cost: 64.8 USD/month.
 2. Kinesis Firehose (S3 Delivery):
   - Data ingestion: 21.6 GB.
   - Cost: 21.6 × 0.029 = 0.63 USD/month.
 3. S3 Storage (for 7 days retention):
   - Stored data: 21.6 GB/month ÷ 4.3 = 5.02 GB/day.
   - Cost for 7 days: 5.02 × 7 × 0.023 = 0.81 USD/month.
 4. Lambda Execution:
   - Total invocations: 21,600.
   - Execution time: 5 seconds/event.
   - Memory: 128 MB.
     - Compute cost:
       21,600 × 5 × (128 / 1,024) × 0.0000166667 = 22.1 USD/month.
     - Invocation cost:
       21,600 ÷ 1,000,000 × 0.20 = 0.0043 USD/month.
 Total Monthly Cost (Second Architecture):
 88.34 USD/month
--
Cost Comparison:- First Architecture: 65.5 USD/month.- Second Architecture: 88.34 USD/month (with 5s/event Lambda execution).
 Key Notes:- The first architecture is more cost-effective, but the second architecture provides longer storage
 retention and additional processing flexibility
