Absolutely! Based on your architecture (two VPCs: Security VPC with WAF/ALB, Application VPC with web/app servers and RDS database), here’s a clear list of metrics/reports you should reasonably expect your SaaS vendor to share with you, and why:

Metrics You Should Request (and Why) for Your Architecture
1. Security VPC (WAF, Firewall, ALB)
Service/Component	Metrics/Reports You Should Get	Why?
WAF / Firewall	- Summary of attacks blocked
- Security incidents affecting your tenant	To know about threats or breaches
Application Load Balancer	- Uptime (availability for your users)
- Error rates (4xx/5xx for your tenant’s traffic)
- Average response times for your requests
- Outage/incident reports	To measure app health for your users

2. Application VPC (Web/App Servers, RDS)
Service/Component	Metrics/Reports You Should Get	Why?
Web/App Servers (WFM, NICE Data Explorer, ASC)	- User activity (logins, sessions, API calls for your tenant)
- Feature usage
- Application uptime for your tenant
- Application performance (response times, errors impacting your users)	To monitor adoption, support, and experience
Database (RDS)	- Amount of data your tenant is storing
- Confirmation of backups for your tenant’s data
- Data-related incidents that affected your tenant (e.g., failed queries, corruption, restore events)	For billing, compliance, and data integrity

3. General SaaS/Tenant Metrics
Area	Metrics/Reports You Should Get	Why?
Availability/Uptime	- Uptime % for your tenant
- Downtime or incident/outage reports	Ensure reliability, meet SLAs
Performance	- Response time/error rates for your users	User experience
Security	- Failed logins, suspicious logins for your users
- Security alerts or incident reports impacting your org	Security awareness
Usage	- Active users, API calls, feature adoption	Billing/planning
Storage	- Data stored for your tenant	Billing/compliance
Backup/Disaster Recovery	- Confirmation of backups/retention policy for your tenant’s data
- DR test outcomes (sometimes)	Data protection, compliance
Support	- Support ticket response/resolution times
- Notifications of planned changes or releases	Transparency, support quality
Compliance	- Audit logs (for your tenant), compliance certifications	Meet regulatory requirements

What You Should NOT Expect:
Raw AWS logs/metrics (CloudWatch for ALB/RDS/WAF/servers)

Backend server CPU/disk/network stats

Full firewall logs or traffic captures

Data/metrics about other tenants

How Will These Be Shared?
Dashboards: Most SaaS vendors provide a portal for real-time and historical metrics.

Scheduled Reports: Monthly/weekly PDF or CSV summaries.

Alerts: Email/SMS/in-app notifications for outages, incidents, or critical security events.

API: Some SaaS vendors provide APIs for you to fetch your usage/performance/security data.

Why Only These?
Security: Protects your data and other tenants’ data.

Relevance: Only shows you what matters for your business and compliance.

SaaS Model: Backend infrastructure is managed by the vendor, so only filtered/tenant-specific info is surfaced.

Summary Table for Your Architecture
Service	What You Get	How Shared
WAF/Firewall	Attack summaries, tenant-specific incidents	Dashboard, email
ALB	Uptime, error rates, latency (your traffic only)	Dashboard, report
Web/App Servers	Usage/activity by your users, app uptime for your tenant	Dashboard
RDS (Database)	Your data usage, backup confirmation, data incidents	Report, compliance doc
General SaaS	Usage, storage, security events, incidents, support stats	Dashboard, report

If you need a sample email to request these metrics from your vendor, or want to see a dashboard layout/mockup, just ask!
