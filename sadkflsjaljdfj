Certainly! Let me provide a step-by-step explanation, focusing on the core points that answer “why CloudWatch metric streams and Firehose must be in the same AWS account” in a straightforward way. I’ll also briefly describe how you can still get metrics from one account into another if needed.

1. AWS’s Same-Account Requirement for Metric Streams → Firehose
Metric Stream "pushes" data: CloudWatch metric streams send metrics continuously to a Firehose delivery stream.

Trust Relationship: To do this, CloudWatch in your account needs permission (via an IAM role) to write to the Firehose.

AWS Security Constraints: AWS has built this so that the Firehose you choose must be in the same AWS account and the same Region as the metric stream. This is stated in AWS documentation.

Why?

Security: The simplest and safest way is to keep both CloudWatch and Firehose resources in the same account. CloudWatch can assume an IAM role in the same account without cross-account or cross-region complexity.

Managed Service Integration: When you create a metric stream and point it to Firehose, AWS automatically sets up or references an IAM role so CloudWatch can deliver data. Having both in the same account avoids confusion with cross-account resource policies.

2. How to Still Achieve “Cross-Account” Results
Although you can’t directly create a metric stream in one account that writes to a Firehose in another account, you can still get the data into another account if that’s your end goal.

Two common approaches:

A. Use a Single “Central Monitoring” Account
Enable cross-account metrics: AWS allows you to link multiple accounts for monitoring (often called cross-account observability). This means that the central “monitoring account” (Account M) has visibility into the metrics from other linked accounts.

Create one metric stream in the monitoring account: Because that account can “see” metrics from the linked accounts, your single metric stream in Account M can effectively include all metrics.

Point that metric stream to a Firehose in Account M: The same-account requirement is met (the stream and Firehose are both in Account M).

Deliver the data wherever you want: Firehose in the monitoring account can now deliver the data to S3, Redshift, or another destination in the same or a different account.

Bottom line: This central approach uses official AWS cross-account features to handle the “visibility” side of metrics. You only have a single metric stream that covers multiple accounts.

B. Multiple Streams into One Storage Bucket (Data Lake)
Separate metric streams in each account: Each account has a metric stream and a Firehose. That satisfies the same-account rule for each metric stream–Firehose pair.

Configure each Firehose to deliver to the same S3 bucket or the same data store (e.g., a central S3 bucket in your “analytics” account).

Set up cross-account bucket permissions: Give each Firehose’s IAM role permission to write to that central S3 bucket. Update the bucket policy so it trusts the Firehose roles in each of the source accounts.

Result: All metrics from each Firehose land in a single location, even though they started in separate accounts.

Bottom line: You end up with a single, consolidated place to store and analyze metric data, even though each account uses its own Firehose.

3. Why Can’t You Skip the Same-Account Rule?
Enforced in the API: When you create a metric stream, it specifically requires the ARN of a Firehose in the same Region/account. If it’s different, the creation fails.

IAM Role Setup: The IAM role that CloudWatch assumes is local to your account. By default, CloudWatch is not configured to assume a cross-account role for metric streams.

Security Boundary: Metrics often contain operational info about your infrastructure. AWS designed the metric streaming mechanism so you only send them out of the account in a deliberate way, via a known Firehose in the same account. This reduces the chance of accidentally sending data to a wrong external account.
