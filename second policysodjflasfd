Explanation
sts:AssumeRole:
This allows the Firehose delivery role in Account A to assume the cross-account role in Account B.
The role in Account B grants Firehose access to the destination S3 bucket for metrics delivery.
Bucket Policy in Account B
To allow Firehose in Account A to write to the S3 bucket in Account B:

Copy code

    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-A:role/Firehose-Delivery-Role"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name",
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
How This Works
Firehose in Account A:

Uses the sts:AssumeRole action to assume the cross-account role in Account B.
Cross-Account Role in Account B:

Grants permissions for Firehose to interact with the S3 bucket in Account B (via the bucket policy).
S3 Bucket in Account B:

Accepts uploads from the Firehose delivery role in Account A, ensuring proper object ownership with bucket-owner-full-control.
Final Notes
If you donâ€™t need CloudWatch Logs, you can remove the logs actions from the original policy.
The minimal permissions setup focuses purely on enabling cross-account delivery of metrics to S3 without any additional logging or debugging permissions.
