reat, let’s break it down by each AWS service/component from your SaaS architecture and explain what customer-facing metrics the SaaS vendor might share for each one:

1. Web Application Firewall (WAF) & Firewall
Customer-facing metrics:

Number of attacks or threats blocked affecting your users (if a major attack targeted your accounts)

Security incident notifications (if your tenant was affected by a breach or DDoS)

Not shared:

Full WAF logs, all blocked IPs/rules (internal only)

2. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Customer-facing metrics:

Service availability: Was your tenant able to access the app?

Error rates (4xx/5xx): How many of your requests failed?

Average response time: How fast/slow were your requests?

Incident reports: Outages or disruptions that affected your users

Not shared:

Raw request logs, backend target health for the whole environment

3. Internet Gateway / Network
Customer-facing metrics:

Incident notifications only if a network issue affects your ability to access the service (e.g., global outage)

Not shared:

Inbound/outbound traffic logs, general network flow stats

4. Application Servers (WFM, NICE Data Explorer, ASC Web/App)
Customer-facing metrics:

App uptime: Was the application available for your users?

User activity: Logins, sessions, API calls for your tenant

Feature usage: Which features your users accessed

Performance for your tenant: Slowness/errors affecting your users

Not shared:

Server resource stats (CPU, memory, disk), full application logs

5. Database (RDS)
Customer-facing metrics:

Your data usage: How much data your tenant is using (for billing/capacity)

Backup status: Confirmation your data is being backed up (sometimes for compliance)

Data-related incidents: If a database issue caused errors for your tenant

Not shared:

Raw database metrics (CPU, storage, replication lag), internal DB logs

6. General SaaS / Tenant-Level
Customer-facing metrics:

Active users: Number of your users using the app

API calls: How much your org is using the system

Storage used: How much data you’re storing

Failed/suspicious logins: Security events for your users

Incident and SLA reports: Any outage or problem that affected your tenant

Not shared:

Aggregate metrics across all tenants, backend infrastructure metrics

Summary Table
Service/Component	Customer Metrics Shared	Internal/Not Shared
WAF/Firewall	Major security events affecting your org	Raw logs, all blocked IPs
Application Load Balancer	Uptime, error rate, response time (your usage)	Raw request logs, target health
Internet Gateway/Network	Outage/incident notices	Traffic logs, network flow stats
Application Servers	App uptime, usage, feature activity	Server stats, full app logs
Database (RDS)	Data usage, backup status, data incidents	DB CPU/storage, internal logs
SaaS/Tenant General	Users, API calls, storage, security events, incidents	Backend, multi-tenant data

Why only these?
Privacy: Keeps other tenants’ data secure and private

Relevance: Only your org’s metrics matter for your business

Security: Prevents leaks of backend or cross-tenant information

Let me know if you want sample wording for requesting these from a SaaS vendor, or if you want a dashboard/example view for a specific service!

how they wil share with us all those

Great question! Here’s how SaaS vendors typically share these customer-facing metrics with you, based on industry best practices:

How SaaS Vendors Share Metrics With Customers
1. Web Dashboard / Portal (Most Common)
You log in to the SaaS web portal.

You get charts, tables, and reports showing only your company’s usage, performance, and security events.

Example:

“Usage” tab shows API calls, active users, storage used, failed logins, etc.

“Availability” or “Status” tab shows uptime, downtime incidents, SLA stats.

2. Scheduled Reports (Email or Download)
The vendor sends regular reports (weekly/monthly) to your email.

Reports can be in PDF, CSV, or Excel format.

Example:

Monthly usage summary

Compliance or backup confirmation reports

Incident summary for your tenant

3. Alerts & Notifications
You get real-time notifications via email, SMS, or in-app alerts for:

Service outages affecting your users

Security incidents (failed logins, suspicious activity)

SLA breaches

4. API Access (For Advanced Customers)
Some vendors offer a metrics API you can use to:

Pull your usage, performance, and incident data programmatically

Integrate metrics into your own BI/reporting tools (like Tableau, PowerBI, Grafana)

Example:

GET /api/v1/metrics/usage returns your org’s stats in JSON format

What You Don’t Get
Direct access to AWS CloudWatch, backend monitoring tools, or logs.

You always see only your own data, never the full infrastructure or other customers’ details.

Example: Typical SaaS Customer Dashboard Sections
Section	What You’ll See
Overview	Uptime, system status, incidents
Usage	Logins, API calls, active users, storage
Security	Failed logins, alerts, password resets
Performance	Response time, error rates (your users)
Reports	Download monthly/weekly CSV or PDF
Incidents	See all incidents that affected your org

Summary
Vendors share metrics via:

Dashboards/portals (most common, self-serve)

Email/downloadable reports

Real-time alerts/notifications

API (for advanced integrations)

You always get metrics filtered to your own organization/tenant only.

If you want, I can draft a sample request for your vendor, or mock up what a dashboard might look like for one of these services! Let me know your preference.

is there any tool or they shend cloud watch metrics with us

Great question! Here’s a clear answer:

Do SaaS Vendors Send CloudWatch Metrics Directly to Customers?
In almost all multi-tenant SaaS models:

No, vendors do NOT send raw AWS CloudWatch metrics to customers.

You won’t get direct access to CloudWatch dashboards, metrics, or logs for their infrastructure (like ALB, RDS, or EC2 instances).

Why?

Security: CloudWatch metrics/logs can include info about other tenants.

Isolation: Each customer must only see their own data.

Abstraction: SaaS is meant to hide backend details from customers.

How Do Vendors Share Metrics Instead?
Vendors typically use tools/platforms that allow them to:

Collect CloudWatch and app metrics internally.

Filter and aggregate those metrics by tenant.

Present the results to you via dashboards, reports, alerts, or APIs—never the raw CloudWatch data.

Popular Tools & Methods Vendors Use
Tool/Platform	How It’s Used	Customer View
Amazon QuickSight	Dashboards built from processed AWS/app data	Customer portal
Tableau/Power BI	Embedded analytics dashboards	Customer dashboard
Grafana (multi-tenant setup)	Filtered dashboards per tenant	Secure web dashboards
Custom Web Apps	Vendor’s own portal/dashboard	Direct web access
Email/CSV/PDF	Automated scheduled reports	Downloadable files
APIs	REST endpoints for tenant-specific data	Integration option

Some advanced vendors use tools like Amazon QuickSight Embedded Analytics or a multi-tenant Grafana setup, where you can only see your own org’s slice.

What About Raw CloudWatch Metrics?
Direct access is almost never provided.

In single-tenant/private cloud scenarios (where the whole environment is just for you), a vendor might share direct CloudWatch dashboards, but this is rare and usually only for very large enterprise contracts.

Summary Table
Method	Get Raw CloudWatch?	Typical for Multi-Tenant SaaS?
Web dashboards (QuickSight, Tableau, Grafana)	NO	YES
Direct CloudWatch access	NO	NO
API (filtered metrics)	NO (processed data)	YES
Scheduled email reports	NO (summary data)	YES

If you want, I can show you how a SaaS provider might build this with QuickSight or Grafana, or explain how you can request these tenant-level dashboards from your vendor. Let me know what’s most useful for you!
